# My Advent of Code Solutions

My solutions to the brilliant [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) created by [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/). I'm a newbie to this (started in 2022) but I might go back and complete the prevous years when I get chance.

## My setup

I'm currenty working in python and using the [advent-of-code-data](https://pypi.org/project/advent-of-code-data/) python module to access the input data. I'm using VS Code and executing the scripts from the root of the repo (hence the paths to arcive the input data files).
