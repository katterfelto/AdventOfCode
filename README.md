# My Advent of Code Solutions

My solutions to the brilliant [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) created by [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/). I'm a newbie to this (started in 2022) but I might go back and complete the prevous years when I get chance.

## My setup

I'm currenty working in python and using the [advent-of-code-data](https://pypi.org/project/advent-of-code-data/) python module to access the input data. I'm using VS Code and executing the scripts from the root of the repo (hence the paths to arcive the input data files).

After day 6 (2022) I realised how unit tests could ease the testing, especially since Eric provides test data and the respective results. I then restructured the previous days solutions so I can retro fit the unit tests.

Day 7 was annoying, I misunderstood the required answer and supplied the directory name when the total size was actually required. I spent over an hour tryng to figure out why the directory was incorrect. I turns out the direcotry was correct I just need to supply the size not the name!
